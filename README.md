# Exploring Satellite Image Classification using CNNs and Vision Transformers
Advanced Topics in Computer Science: Semester 1 2022

This aim of this project is to compare multiple deep learning approaches to perform satellite image classification for the EuroSAT dataset. Multiple CNN architectures, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception will be compared to the vision transformer, a state-of-the-art technique for image classification.
