# Intelligent Satellites for Agricultural Monitoring using Convolutional Neural Networks and Mobile-ViT
Advanced Topics in Computer Science: Semester 1 2022

Recent advancements in remote sensing technologies have enabled the development of intelligent satellites to collect personalised real-time sensing data for applications in land use monitoring, climate change management, and disaster recovery. The aim of this paper is to use EuroSAT, a novel dataset for land use classification, to understand and compare various convolutional neural network architectures to Mobile-ViT, a lightweight, low-latency deep learning model. We explore the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency in the conducted experiments by including inference time as an evaluation metric. We observe accuracies above 88% for all models assessed and a very small inference time for the Mobile-ViT architecture, highlighting the potential of lightweight deep learning models to be implemented in intelligent satellites for real-time land use monitoring.
