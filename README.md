# Intelligent Satellites for Agricultural Monitoring using Convolutional Neural Networks and Mobile-ViT
Advanced Topics in Computer Science: Semester 1 2022

This aim of this project is to compare multiple deep learning approaches to perform satellite image classification for the EuroSAT dataset. Multiple CNN architectures, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception will be compared to Mobile-ViT, a newly proposed mobile vision transformer. The project will also explore real-world applications of deploying lightweight deep learning models on intelligent satellites to collect personalised real-time sensing data, for applications such as agricultural land use monitoring.
